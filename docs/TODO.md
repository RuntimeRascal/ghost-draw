# TODO List

## Phase One
- [X] Settings window settings persist. The window needs to look modern and have innovative design that matches the name of the app and what it does. We can use the logo in Assets and the window should not have the default windows title bar instead look much more modern. Use a fancy gradient as the window background.
- [X] Custom ghost/pencil icon in the system tray.
- [X] Allow changing the color of the drawing. Can change in settings that persist. Allow cycling through color options by right clicking on the mouse.
- [X] Allow changing the size/brush thickness of the drawing. Can change in settings that persist. Allow increasing/decreasing the size with the scroll wheel. 
- [X] Have a max and a min size setting.
- [X] Create custom colored pencil cursor. The cursor will have the tip colored to match the currently drawing color.
- [ ] Settings allows choosing keyboard combo to activate drawing mode.
- [X] Setting to lock drawing mode. If drawing mode is locked setting is true when press key combo we lock the drawing mode in and no longer require user to hold the combo. Drawing mode continues until the user presses the key combo again or ESC is pressed.
