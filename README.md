## ??? Architecture

GhostDraw is built with modern .NET practices and WPF:

### Technology Stack
- **WPF** - UI framework and overlay rendering
- **Global Windows Hooks** - Low-level keyboard/mouse capture
- **Dependency Injection** - Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
- **Structured Logging** - Serilog + Microsoft.Extensions.Logging
- **.NET 8** - Latest LTS framework

### Key Components

```
?? GhostDraw
??? ?? OverlayWindow          - Transparent fullscreen drawing canvas
??? ?? SettingsWindow          - Cyberpunk-themed configuration UI
??? ?? AppSettingsService      - Settings management & persistence
??? ?? GlobalKeyboardHook      - System-wide hotkey capture
??? ??? DrawingManager          - Stroke rendering & input handling
??? ??? UserControls            - Reusable settings panels
```

### Design Principles

? **Safety First** - User must never be locked out of their system  
? **Fast Hooks** - All hook callbacks complete in < 5ms  
? **Graceful Failure** - Exceptions are caught, logged, and handled  
? **Clean Resources** - Hooks and resources always released on exit  
? **Structured Logging** - Comprehensive diagnostics without performance impact

## ?? Troubleshooting

### Drawing overlay doesn't appear
- Check if the hotkey is conflicting with another application
- Try changing the hotkey in Settings
- Ensure .NET 8 runtime is installed

### Application won't start
- Right-click `GhostDraw.exe` ? **Run as administrator**
- Check Windows Event Viewer for crash logs
- Review logs in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GhostDraw\logs\`

### Drawing is laggy or slow
- Reduce brush thickness range (lower max value)
- Close other resource-intensive applications
- Check CPU usage in Task Manager

### Hotkey doesn't work
- Verify the key combination isn't used by Windows or other apps
- Try a different key combination
- Restart GhostDraw after changing hotkeys

---

## ?? Logging

GhostDraw uses structured logging with configurable levels:

- **Verbose** - Everything (very noisy)
- **Debug** - Detailed diagnostic information
- **Information** - General application flow (default)
- **Warning** - Unexpected but recoverable situations
- **Error** - Errors that don't crash the app
- **Fatal** - Critical errors requiring restart

Logs are stored in: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GhostDraw\logs\`

Access logs via **Settings** ? **LOGS** ? **OPEN FOLDER**
